- An IDE (like [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and run:

### 3. Open the Project

Open the project in your chosen IDE. If you're using Android Studio or VS Code, these IDEs should automatically detect the Flutter project.

### 4. Set Up an Emulator or Device

To run the app, you need an Android emulator or a physical device:
- **Using an Emulator:** Set up an Android Emulator through your IDE. Refer to the [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator) for guidance.

### 5. Run the Application

Finally, you can run the application:
- **From the terminal:** Run `flutter run` in the project directory.
